# TheSwedishTimes

This is a demo Webapp to show the UI/UX improvements for TheSwedishTimes website. It is created using Typescript, React, and Tailwind.

Here are the improvements made over their existing website:

1. The website's design should be simplified and made more consistent. This can be done by using a consistent color scheme, font, and layout throughout the website. We can increase whitespaces too. Reduce sizes of subtexts in articles and increase size of headings or make them bold.
2. The website's navigation is made clearer and more concise. This is done by using clear labels and menus, and by grouping related content together. The button sizes are increased and made more responsive for clear navigation.
3. The website is made more responsive so that it adapts to the size of the screen it is being viewed on.
